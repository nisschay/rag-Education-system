# Docker Compose - Orchestrates multiple containers
#
# What this does:
# - Defines two services (containers): backend and frontend
# - Sets up networking so they can communicate
# - Configures environment variables and storage
#
# Usage:
#   docker-compose up --build     # Build and start everything
#   docker-compose up -d          # Start in background (detached)
#   docker-compose down           # Stop and remove containers
#   docker-compose logs -f        # View logs
#
# The frontend will be at http://localhost
# The backend API will be at http://localhost:8000
